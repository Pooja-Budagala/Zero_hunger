# Zero_hunger
This project aims to achieve a future where everyone has access to safe, nutritious, and affordable food, ensuring global food security for generations to come. By aligning with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 2.1, to end hunger and ensure food accessibility, and SDG Target 2.2, to eliminate all forms of malnutrition, predictive analytics plays a crucial role. The project focuses on predicting and managing the food supply chain, optimizing resource use, and addressing emerging challenges such as climate change and population growth. Data-driven predictive models forecast crop yields and identify potential threats to agricultural production, including pests, diseases, and extreme weather conditions. By analysing historical data, these models enable farmers to make informed decisions to mitigate risks and ensure food availability. Data on soil conditions, weather patterns, crop health, and resource usage allow for targeted interventions to increase productivity, reduce resource waste, and minimize environmental impact. Pest outbreak modelling, based on data about weather patterns, past outbreaks, and pest-chemical-plant interactions, predicts rising pest populations and suggests optimal responses, such as precise pesticide application. IoT sensors monitor shipment conditions in real time to protect food products during transit. In manufacturing, predictive analytics using digital twins helps identify and mitigate contamination risks. Additionally, by analysing past health reports and real-time data, the project identifies supply chain vulnerabilities, such as potential outbreaks of fruit diseases in specific regions.
